# FinalProject
Goal: <br/>
Extend assignment 4 to include reflection and translucency <br/>
(complete by May 17th) <br/>
Might try to incorporate Fresnel equations for more realistic looking images.<br/>
<br/>
Stretch: <br/>
Experimenting with noise and foam to create water effect <br/>
(complete by May 19th) <br/>
<br/>
Keywords: Environment mapping, cube map.<br/>
